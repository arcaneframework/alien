Alien's Coding Style
====================

Naming
------

 - CamelCase for c++ objects
 - underscore_separator_and_no_capital for filenames

C++
---

Alien is (at the moment) a C++ library. We follow directives of `Arcane`, mainly:
 - C++14 code
 - Avoid passing parameters by reference (specially it is forbidden for all *Array* classes).

File Organization
